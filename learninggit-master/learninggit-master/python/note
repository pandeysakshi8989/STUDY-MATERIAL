Your code looks like it is set up to track student attendance and send email notifications based on their attendance records. However, there are a few potential issues and improvements that can be made. Here are some suggestions:

### 1. **Use `==` for Comparisons**
Ensure that all instances of `is` used for comparing values, such as student roll numbers, are replaced with `==`. This applies in the following places:

```python
if sheet.cell(row=i, column=1).value == student:
```

### 2. **Quit SMTP Connection Outside the Loop**
Currently, you are quitting the SMTP connection after sending the first email. This should be done after all emails have been sent. Move `s.quit()` outside of the loop in both `mailstu` and `mailstaff` functions.

#### Updated Functions
```python
def mailstu(li, msg): 
    from_id = 'ram0102@gmail.com'
    pwd = '1234'
    s = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587, timeout=120) 
    s.starttls() 
    s.login(from_id, pwd) 

    for i in range(len(li)): 
        to_id = li[i] 
        message = MIMEMultipart() 
        message['Subject'] = 'Attendance report'
        message.attach(MIMEText(msg, 'plain')) 
        content = message.as_string() 
        s.sendmail(from_id, to_id, content) 
    
    s.quit()  # Quit the SMTP connection here
    print("Mail sent to students") 

def mailstaff(mail_id, msg): 
    from_id = 'ram0102@gmail.com'
    pwd = '1234'
    to_id = mail_id 
    message = MIMEMultipart() 
    message['Subject'] = 'Lack of attendance report'
    message.attach(MIMEText(msg, 'plain')) 
    s = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587, timeout=120) 
    s.starttls() 
    s.login(from_id, pwd) 
    content = message.as_string() 
    s.sendmail(from_id, to_id, content) 
    s.quit()  # Quit the SMTP connection here
    print('Mail sent to staff') 
```

### 3. **Error Handling**
Consider adding error handling, especially for sending emails and accessing the Excel file. This can help you identify issues without crashing the program.

#### Example for Email Sending
```python
try:
    s.sendmail(from_id, to_id, content)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to send email to {to_id}: {e}")
```

### 4. **Store Credentials Securely**
Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like email addresses and passwords directly in the code. Use environment variables or configuration files instead.

### 5. **Improving User Input Validation**
You may want to add input validation to ensure the user inputs valid data (e.g., valid roll numbers and subject choices).

### 6. **Refactoring for Clarity**
Consider breaking down your code into smaller functions for clarity, especially for sections handling user input or processing attendance. This will improve readability and maintainability.

### 7. **Check File Existence**
Make sure the file `attendance.xlsx` exists at the specified path before trying to open it. You can add a check like this:

```python
import os

if not os.path.exists(r'C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\sakshi\attendance.xlsx'):
    print("Attendance file not found!")
    exit()
```

### Conclusion
By implementing these improvements, your code will be more robust, maintainable, and secure. Let me know if you need further assistance or clarification on any point!


















The `TypeError` you're encountering indicates that you are trying to concatenate a string with an integer, which is not allowed in Python. This likely happens when you are trying to increment the value of `m`, which is expected to be an integer but is actually a string.

### Where the Error Occurs
In your code, `m` is being set to the value of a cell from the Excel sheet:

```python
m = sheet.cell(row=i, column=3).value  # or column 4 or 5
```

If the cell contains a string (e.g., if it was initially empty or has been formatted as text), trying to do `m = m + 1` will raise a `TypeError`.

### How to Fix It
You need to ensure that `m` is treated as an integer. Here’s how to modify that section of your code:

1. **Convert to Integer:**
   Before you increment `m`, check if it’s a string and convert it to an integer. If the cell is empty or contains a non-integer value, initialize `m` to `0`.

### Updated Code Snippet
You can modify the relevant parts of your code like this:

```python
for i in range(2, r+1): 
    if y == 1: 
        if sheet.cell(row=i, column=1).value == student: 
            m = sheet.cell(row=i, column=3).value 
            if m is None:  # Handle None case
                m = 0
            else:
                m = int(m)  # Convert to integer if it's a string
            m += 1
            sheet.cell(row=i, column=3).value = m 
            savefile() 
            no_of_days.append(m) 
            row_num.append(i) 

    elif y == 2: 
        if sheet.cell(row=i, column=1).value == student: 
            m = sheet.cell(row=i, column=4).value 
            if m is None:
                m = 0
            else:
                m = int(m)  # Convert to integer if it's a string
            m += 1
            sheet.cell(row=i, column=4).value = m 
            no_of_days.append(m) 
            row_num.append(i) 

    elif y == 3: 
        if sheet.cell(row=i, column=1).value == student: 
            m = sheet.cell(row=i, column=5).value 
            if m is None:
                m = 0
            else:
                m = int(m)  # Convert to integer if it's a string
            m += 1
            sheet.cell(row=i, column=5).value = m 
            row_num.append(i) 
            no_of_days.append(m) 
```

### Summary
- **Check for `None`:** If the cell is empty, set `m` to `0`.
- **Convert to Integer:** Always convert `m` to an integer before performing arithmetic operations.

After making these changes, your code should work without raising the `TypeError`. Let me know if you need further help!
