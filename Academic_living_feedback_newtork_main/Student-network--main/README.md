This is a Student Experience and Resource Review System ,an integrated platform designed to enhance the campus experience by allowing students to provide and access reviews and information across multiple aspects of their academic and living environment. This system will facilitate student feedback on various elements such as hostel accommodations, tiffin facilities, departmental resources, placement services, subject content, and library services. It will also include features for students to provide insights on accommodation availability, tiffin center quality, and local market areas.
Key functionalities of the system include:
1. Review and Rating: Students can submit and view reviews and ratings for hostels, tiffin services, academic departments, placement support, subjects, and library resources.
2. Feature Suggestions: Students can propose new features or improvements for the system, which can be reviewed and potentially implemented by the administrators.
3. Student Interaction: With admin permission, students can engage in chats with each other to exchange advice, seek guidance, and collaborate on projects. Additionally, alumni can offer guidance to current students, and senior students can mentor juniors.
4. Group Requests: Students can request the creation of interest-based groups for better networking and collaboration.
5. Admin Oversight: The system includes tools for administrators to oversee interactions, manage group requests, and implement suggested features.
